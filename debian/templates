Default: false
Description: Enable the PulseAudio TCP protocol?
 To support audio in LXC containers and in particular to play audio in the
 background (when they are not running on the current virtual terminal) the
 PulseAudio server on the host needs to allow TCP connections from the LXC
 network (10.0.3.0/24).
 .
 If you say "Yes" here the PulseAudio system and client configuration files
 are modified to enable and use the TCP protocol.
